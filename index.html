		<h2>About Zoro</h2>
		<p>also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of their two swordsmen. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of the crew and the first to join, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.

		As a master of Santoryu, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the four most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy, Sanji and Jinbe. His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.</p>

		<!-- Fights -->

		<h2>Best Fights</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Zoro vs Mihawk</li>
			<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gVhe25WVQ80/maxresdefault.jpg">
			<p>Zoro's first major fight wasn't against the 'struggle against but eventually win' kind of opponent, it was an opponent that he absolutely stood no chances against! In fact, Zoro still doesn't stand a chance against this man-- Dracule Mihawk, the world's strongest swordsman.
			By Mihawk's own words, that 'fight' was one between a rabbit and a beast. No matter how ferocious the rabbit was, it'd never stand a chance against a beast. But in spite of that loss, Zoro still gained so much from that encounter.</p>

			<li>Zoro vs Ryuma</li>
			<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rP-QS3kYL._AC_SX425_.jpg">
			<p>Zoro had two fights in the Thriller Bark Saga that were both equally iconic. Having said so, due to Zoro's confrontation with Kuma being more of a one-sided massacre rather than a fight, we will rule it out.
			With that out of the way, the only Zoro fight worthy of the grand stage in the Thriller Bark arc has to be Zoro vs Ryuma. This battle's beauty can mainly be traced back to its aesthetics. A fight between two passionate swordsmen provided the fans with what could only be described as peak entertainment.</p>

			<li>Zoro vs Hody Jones</li>
			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/0/0d/Zoro_vs_Hordy_Jones.png/revision/latest?cb=20120212030647&path-prefix=es">
			<p>In most cases scenarios, Zoro wouldn't have been a match to any major arc's final boss; and this is what makes this particular fight even more interesting.
			Hody Jones, the supposed central antagonist of the Fishman Island saga, was bodied and overwhelmed by Zoro--and get this, it all unraveled underwater! Some might argue that this particular fight was the finest of the entire Saga!</p>

			<li>Zoro vs Pica</li>
			<img src="http://pm1.narvii.com/7108/a756c037195e4b49967bcfbd100b53019e97bc59r1-956-674v2_uhq.jpg">
			<p>The Dressrosa arc was the first post-time-skip arc where Luffy and the gang had their true limits tested. Doflamingo and his executives proved to be really troublesome to deal with, especially the former.
			That being said, of all the Straw Hats, Zoro was the one who had it the easiest. Not because his opponent was weak, contrarily, it was due to Zoro's strength being off the radar. Pica, the 2nd strongest of the Donquixote Family, didn't have what it takes to push Zoro to his utmost limits.</p>

			<li>Zoro vs Kamazou</li>
			<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-xHDASShYc/maxresdefault.jpg">
			<p>The Yonko saga comprises three major story arcs: Zou arc, the Whole Cake Island arc, and Wano arc. Zoro didn't have a chance to flex his swords during the former two, but he did have a chance in Wano.
			Zoro's battles in Wano thus far were skirmishes at best, but even these skirmishes had a punch to them. Moreover, these brief confrontations were animated really well. Some, such as Zoro vs Kamazou, even outdid the manga.</p>
